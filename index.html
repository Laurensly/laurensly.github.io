                    <p class="lead">Currently, I am a student at the University of Florida (go Gators!) I am pursuing a combined Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Information Systems from one of the top-ranked business programs in the nation. 
<br><br>
Since I was thirteen years old, I have been managing myself as a professional performer, teaching me invaluable business skills such as marketing, data and financial analysis, and general business operations. My drive stems from my passion for entertainment, analyzing and solving problems, people, and, above everything, creation.
 <br><br>
Even though I have a natural tendency to think creatively and view things differently than most, I am pursuing a STEM degree to increase my logical thinking skills as well. By pursuing a technology degree, I am able to quickly understand new database structures and operation systems. My goal is to expand my range of skills, so that I can solve whatever problem is thrown at me, while also using my creative skills to see beyond an unsparing equation.
<br><br>
My plans, as of now, consist of building my first app, working on new inventions, recording a new song for iTunes, working on projects that combine technology and music, as well as contributing as a committee member of several organizations!
<br><br>
I hope to intern with companies related to my areas of interest so that I may be able to offer them any skills I have acquired from my experiences.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Using 10 guitar chords, I have written over 1,000 songs. 
                        <br><br>
                        It all began when I sat down at a piano as a child, and began to play solely by ear. Onwards, I began to write poetry and started taking it more seriously by learning the guitar and performing for crowds at age thirteen. <br><br>
My first show was at the legendary venue, Freebird Live. This venue has hosted award-winning and world-renowned artists such as Jack Johnson, Andy Grammer, The Dirty Heads, Twenty One Pilots, and more. I've been privileged to appear on local news stations, such as Channel 4 News and First Coast Living, to showcase my songs and brand. 
<br><br>
For the past few years, I have been fortunate to perform for charities such as UF's "Light the Night" for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, or Relay For Life, an organization made up of over 4 million people, whose goal is to save lives and spread awareness about cancer. <br><br>
Throughout this journey, I have met so many brilliant people. Most of all, I have consistently been told that my songs have aided someone through a tough time or have made their day better. These are the things that drive me to keep going.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I remember being a little girl, sitting on my dad's lap as he typed on the computer, mesmerized. Since then, I have had a strong interest in technology. I was fairly advanced, at a young age, with navigating around operating systems, which has progressed as I aged. So, typically when asked to figure something out on a computer, I can quickly find a solution.
                        <br><br>
With my major, it is not so heavily focused on the technical side of things, nor the business side. Information Systems students basically get a well-balanced blend.
<br><br>
Undoubtedly, technology is disrupting every industry, but in so much more depth than people realize, which is another reason I really wanted to be involved with technology... it is changing the world. Currently, I have a strong interest in front-end user experience, but am still discovering new opportunities every day. I thoroughly enjoy processes such as website-building and design because I get the chance to think creatively in order to deliver attractive and efficient interfaces.
                        <br><br>
Whether a piece of art or technology, quality analysis is key. I have applied my knowledge of technology in multiple ways, like for music. Facebook has a platform in which I can use demographics for marketing. So, when I released my first song on iTunes, I went through to see who had liked my page and what their interests were, what artists they listened to, and what they enjoyed. So, I used this to know who to promote to, and ended up increasing my likes from 200 to 1,000, which has helped me learn about how much of an impact that data has on a company. I did a fairly substantial amount of research on this and found that, in a nutshell, without analyzing data, a company is basically operating in the dark.
